# achoz

like a web search, but for your personal files. demo [here](https://achoz.ahoxus.org)

what it will do is just normalize your all documents, and later it will be easy to search. Like suppose you read something fantastic in any of your pdf file, but after sometime you forgot the name of that pdf. Here web search may not help you but achoz surely gonna help you to find that file. 

### Story 
> cregox have a lot of data. files, emails, messages, web links, web content, etc. they also are of different kinds; text, video, audio, apps, etc.
when trying to find something they do remember to be there, sometimes it gets impossible!
the goal of achoz is making cregox self-data-searching-life not only easier, but enable a new world of possibilities, in which they don’t have to worry anymore how to store data for themselves (as long as it’s stored with open and free standards).
